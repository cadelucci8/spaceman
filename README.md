# SPACEMAN

SPACEMAN is a space-themed version of Hangman. A randomized hidden word is displayed as underscores and the player must choose letters once at a time in an attempt to guess the word correctly. Each correct guess displays the letter(s) above in the hidden word. Each incorrect guess displays the spaceman losing a body part. Six wrong guesses results in the spaceman losing all of his body parts and the player losing the game. If the player can correctly guess the hidden word, the game is won.
